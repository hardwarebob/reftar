# Reftar

reftar is a utility I wrote after discovering there were a total of zero tools for moving files with referenced blocks (reflinks) between filesystems - even of the same type. This struck me as insane, so I developed this utility, inspired and heavily drawing from tar, but with arbitrary data reference support.


I'm currently working on the [File format](docs/FILEFORMAT.md)
